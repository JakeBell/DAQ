Data Acquistion Program

This program is a translation of the Acqiris program Get8bitMultisegment.c into python code. The ctypes library is
used to allow the Python code to interact with the Acqiris device drivers. Future plans are to completely seperate 
all C/C++ from Python and recreate all of the driver functions to work purely with Python data types.
